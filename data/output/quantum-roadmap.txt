Quantum journey

  Expand the utility of 

quantum computing.

  Extend algorithms on 
quantum computing + HPC 
and demonstrate error 
correction code. 

Demonstrate first example 
of scientific quantum 
advantage and a fault-
tolerant module.

Diversify quantum 
advantage and entangle 
fault-tolerant modules.

Deliver the first fault-tolerant 
quantum computer.

Unlock the full power of 
quantum computing at scale.

Strategy overview

  Demonstrate accurate 

execution of a quantum circuit 
at a scale beyond exact classical 
simulation. (5K gates on 156 
qubits)

We will release Quantum + HPC 
tools that will leverage Night-
hawk, a new higher-connectivity 
quantum processor able to exe-
cute more complex circuits. 

We will demonstrate the 
first examples of quantum 
advantage using a quantum 
computer with HPC.

The scale, quality, speed of the 
quantum computer will improve 
to allow executing quantum 
circuits at a scale of 10K gates 
on a 1000+ qubits.

The first fault-tolerant quantum 
computer will be available to 
clients and allow execution of 
100M gates on 200 qubits.

Scale fault-tolerant quantum 
computers to run circuits of 
1 billion gates on up to 2000 
qubits, unlocking the full power 
of quantum computing.

Why this matters to our 
clients and the world

  We have created a platform 
where algorithm and application 
developers can develop candi-
date circuits at utility scale.

We will provide tools and 
methods for exploring quantum 
advantage on a pre-fault-tolerant 
quantum computer working 
alongside HPC.

Users and partners will unlock 
the first example of scientific 
advantage on a pre-fault-tolerant 
quantum computer working 
alongside HPC.

Users will be able to run an 
expanded set of examples 
demonstrating the scientific 
value of pre-fault-tolerant 
quantum computing. 

Users will be able to run the 
next scale of applications using 
the first fault-tolerant quantum 
computer unlocking  a wider, 
more complex set of use cases.

The technology or 
innovations that will 
make this possible

  Developed and deployed 
Qiskit Functions with our part-
ners to deliver domain specific 
applications at utility scale.

  Used AI to develop advanced 
classical transpilation methods.
  Demonstrated with partners 

a prototype  quantum-centric 
supercomputer operating at 
utility scale.

Nighthawk, a modular processor 
with 120 square lattice qubits 
will allow more complex 
calculations using the same 
circuit depth.
New and improved mitigation 
tools will leverage classical HPC 
to expand the set of circuits that 
can be accurately run with 5000 
two-qubit gates.
To prepare for the future, we will 
demonstrate c-couplers and next 
generation packaging for fault-
tolerant quantum computing with 
the Loon quantum processor. 

Our quantum processors will im-
prove in quality to allow running 
7,500 gates on up to 360 qubits.
With our partners, we will define 
a use case benchmarking toolkit 
to evaluate candidates for 
quantum advantage.
We will deliver mapping and 
profiling tools for quantum + 
HPC workflows.
To prepare for the future, Kooka-
burra will demonstrate a single 
module out of Starling consisting 
of a logical processing unit and 
quantum memory.

The performance of our Night-
hawk processor will improve to 
allow circuits with up to 10,000 
gates on up to 1080 qubits.
The first set of computation 
libraries will be developed to 
simplify and optimize quantum + 
HPC workflows.
A new workflow accelerator will 
streamline execution for a known 
advantage-scale workflow.
To prepare for the future, the 
Cockatoo processor will demon-
strate entanglement of two mod-
ules using a universal adapter.

The first fault-tolerant quantum 
computer will power a quan-
tum-enhanced HPC architecture 
with a complete fault-tolerant 
quantum ISA.
With a fault-tolerant architecture, 
the size of the circuits will 
increase to 100M operations, 
enabling the development of more 
sophisticated circuit libraries.
To prepare for the future, we will 
continue to scale electronics, 
infrastructure, and software to 
reduce footprint, cost, and energy 
usage in preparation for Blue Jay.

Quantum computers running 
algorithms using billions of 
gates are expected to enable 
general applications in security, 
chemistry, machine learning, 
and optimization.

Scaling fault-tolerant quantum 
computing to 1 billion gates on 
up to 2000 qubits with a power 
consumption of 2 megawatts will 
require a new control elections 
and cryogenics infrastructure.   
Extensions of the computation 
and circuit libraries will scale 
and diversify quantum + HPC 
workflows across industries.
For the future, we will scale 
beyond Blue Jay with the devel-
opment of distributed quantum 
computing, bringing together the 
fields of quantum communication 
and quantum computation.
